    The preface contains code that is used by the macros -- or rather, by the code into which macros expand -- but
    are kept in a separate file so that they are not themselves seen as macros and compiled by SweetJS.

    The macro usage file, on the other hand, does not strictly need to be in a separate file. I only do that for
    organizational purposes.
